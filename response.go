InsightOps REST API

### Overview  Our REST API lets you use InsightOps through HTTP requests. Currently, the REST API allows you to perform the majority of the actions available through the UI, and has some additional functionality that is not available through the UI. You may use this API to automate common tasks (for example, via shell scripts), and to generally interact with InsightOps programmatically.  This page precisely describes the REST API and serves as a reference for the API. Each HTTP method and each URL endpoint is documented in a self-contained unit so that users only need to read about the HTTP methods relevant to them.  ### Terminology  * A **log entry** is an individual log event. * A **log** is a collection of log entries, or a single log stream. * A **log set** is a logical-only collection of logs, i.e. logs can be in multiple logsets and deleting a logset only deletes the relation between logs, not the logs themselves. * [Log Entry Query Language](https://docs.rapid7.com/insightops/log-search) (**LEQL**) is the query language used in Insight Ops to search log data.
